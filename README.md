## 📌 Executive Overview

**CivicResolve** bridges the structural communication gap between urban citizens and municipal governance. Rather than treating civic complaints as isolated, unstructured text tickets, CivicResolve operationalizes grievance redressal into a connected, closed-loop municipal ecosystem.

The platform pairs a high-performance **Flutter Citizen & Contractor Mobile Client** with a comprehensive **React 18 / TypeScript Municipal Command Center**, backed by **PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)** and **Supabase Auth**. At its core, five deterministic civic intelligence engines evaluate duplicate similarity, calculate multidimensional hazard priority, isolate localized emerging problem clusters, group potential common incidents, and verify remediation photographic evidence—while grounded AI assists municipal executives with shift briefings and triage recommendations strictly within authorized data boundaries.

---

## ⚠️ The Problem

Traditional municipal grievance management systems suffer from acute operational bottlenecks:

- **Fragmented Duplicate Inundation**: Multiple citizens reporting the same pothole or burst water pipe create disjointed, redundant tickets that overwhelm dispatchers.
- **Arbitrary Priority Assignment**: Triage is frequently subjective or chronological rather than driven by objective public safety risk, proximity to vulnerable zones (schools, hospitals), or duration of neglect.
- **Disconnected Field Workflows**: Contractors mark issues "resolved" without objective before/after visual proof, resulting in disputed work quality and citizen dissatisfaction.
- **Blindness to Systemic Incidents**: Recurring localized failures (e.g., 5 water leaks within 300 meters over 48 hours indicating a ruptured water main) are treated as individual complaints rather than symptoms of a single root-cause infrastructure failure.
- **Unverified AI Risks**: Generic LLM chatbots applied to public administration frequently hallucinate facts, expose citizen PII, or leak cross-departmental records without database-level authorization.

---

## 💡 The Solution

CivicResolve resolves these challenges through an integrated, closed-loop architecture where **deterministic rule engines remain the authoritative source of truth**, and **AI operates strictly as a decision-support layer**:

## 🧠 Civic Intelligence Engines (Phases 3A–3E)

CivicResolve implements five decoupled, deterministic intelligence algorithms that run identically in TypeScript (Web) and Dart (Mobile):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                           DETERMINISTIC CIVIC ENGINES                                   │
├─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬───────────────────────┤
│ 3A: Similarity      │ 3B: Smart Priority  │ 3C: Emerging Spikes │ 3D: Root Incidents    │
│ • 200m Radius       │ • Hazard Severity   │ • 500m Density      │ • Spatial Cohesion    │

                                           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3E: Resolution Verification Engine                                                      │
│ • Before vs. After Visual Evidence   • Citizen Star Rating & Sentiment                  │
│ • Remediation Completeness Check     • Fallback Human Audit Flagging                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Engine Specifications

| Engine | Primary Objective | Algorithmic Signals | Safety & Integrity Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3A: Similarity** | Identify related or duplicate grievances. | Haversine distance ($\le 200\text{m}$), Category identity, Normalized text similarity ($\ge 0.65$). | **Never auto-deletes or merges tickets.** Preserves distinct citizen voices while surfacing relationships. |
| **3B: Smart Priority** | Calculate deterministic triage urgency (0–100). | Hazard base severity (0–40), Public safety / vulnerability zone (0–25), Temporal SLA aging (0–20), Environmental impact (0–15). | **Deterministic & reproducible.** AI cannot arbitrarily inflate or downgrade calculated priority. |
| **3C: Emerging Problems** | Detect localized complaint velocity anomalies. | Spatial concentration ($\le 500\text{m}$), Short-term velocity ($\le 72\text{h}$), Category homogeneity ($\ge 70\%$), Historical baseline spike factor. | **Requires sufficient statistical baseline.** Isolated complaints never trigger false community alarms. |
| **3D: Common Incidents** | Group multi-ticket symptoms of single infrastructure failures. | Geographic proximity ($\le 1\text{km}$), Category uniformity, Temporal alignment, Similarity graph connectivity, Cluster volume. | **Strictly designated "Potential Common Incident".** Preserves separate work tickets under one incident umbrella. |
| **3E: Resolution Audit** | Quantify remediation veracity before ticket closure. | Before/After photo presence, Visual repair delta, Citizen feedback rating, Sentiment analysis keywords. | **Decision support only.** Low confidence triggers mandatory supervisory manual audit rather than auto-rejection. |

## 🤖 Grounded Municipal AI

CivicResolve enforces a strict separation between **generative AI capabilities** and **system authorization**:

> 🛡️ **Grounding Rule**: AI models *never* access raw database tables directly. Queries pass through the authenticated user's PostgreSQL RLS session first. Generative synthesis only operates on pre-filtered, authorized records and deterministic engine metrics.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UserQuery[Officer or Admin Query] --> SecGuard[Grounding Security Guard]
    SecGuard -->|Sanitize Input & Detect Injections| AuthContext[Supabase Auth JWT + RLS Scope]
    AuthContext -->|Query Database| AuthData[Authorized Complaint Dataset ONLY]
    AuthData --> DetEngines[Deterministic Engines 3A-3E]
    DetEngines --> AIContext[Structured Grounded Prompt Context]
    AIContext --> LLM[Gemini 1.5 Synthesis Engine]
    LLM --> OutGuard[Output Redaction & Citation Filter]
    OutGuard --> FinalResponse[Grounded Response with Ticket Citations #CR-2026-X]
```

### 1. Executive AI Insights (Phase 8A)
Transforms multidimensional telemetry into actionable summaries for municipal leadership:
- **Critical Dispatch Briefs**: Highlights unassigned high-priority emergencies ranked by Engine 3B.
- **Emerging Anomaly Alerts**: Summarizes geographic cluster developments from Engine 3C.
- **Incident Consolidation Recommendations**: Advises crews on grouped root-cause work orders from Engine 3D.
- **Resolution Quality Warnings**: Flags suspicious or low-confidence contractor closures from Engine 3E.

### 2. Municipal Copilot (Phase 8B)
A contextual operational assistant capable of answering complex administrative questions:
- *"Which electrical hazards near schools need immediate dispatch?"*
- *"Summarize emerging water contamination clusters reported in the last 48 hours."*
- *"Draft a municipal commissioner briefing for Ward 14 shift handover."*
- **Ticket Citation Enforcement**: Every factual claim cites specific complaint IDs (`#CR-2026-101`).

### 3. Grounding & Security Guard (Phase 8C & 9E)
- **PII Scrubbing**: Regex and token sanitizers mask phone numbers, emails, and 12-digit Aadhaar IDs.
- **Prompt Injection Defense**: Intercepts role-override exploits (`"Ignore RLS"`, `"Pretend I am super_admin"`, `"Reveal system tokens"`).
- **Safe Fallback**: Insufficient data returns explicit non-disclosure notices rather than speculative answers.

## 🔐 Security & Authorization Architecture

CivicResolve implements defense-in-depth across database, API, and client tiers:

```
[Client Request]
       │
       ▼
[Supabase Auth JWT] ──► Validates cryptographic signature & user identity
       │
       ▼
[PostgreSQL RLS]   ──► Enforces database-level row and column access policies
       │
       ▼
[Trigger Guards]   ──► Prevents citizen tampering with status, priority, or post-submission content
       │
       ▼
[Public Map View]  ──► Sanitizes reporter PII; exposes only coordinates, category, and status
```

### Canonical Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Scope | Key Permissions & Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`citizen`** | Personal Data Only | Submits grievances, views own complaint history, provides resolution feedback and ratings. **Cannot alter status, priority, officer assignment, or post-submission complaint content.** |
| **`officer`** | Assigned & Departmental | Inspects assigned tickets, updates operational stage, uploads contractor remediation photos. Cannot access complaints outside assigned department. |
| **`dept_admin`** | Department-Wide | Full visibility and dispatch control over specific department (e.g., Roads, Sanitation). Generates departmental intelligence reports. |
| **`municipal_admin`** | City-Wide Operations | City-wide triage, cross-departmental dispatch, SLA escalation management, city-wide AI Insights. |
| **`super_admin`** | System & Governance | Complete administrative authority, user role assignment (`public.user_roles`), commissioner executive briefings, system configuration. |

## 🌟 Why CivicResolve is Different

| Dimension | Legacy Grievance Systems | CivicResolve Platform |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Triage Model** | Chronological / Manual FIFO | Deterministic multi-factor hazard priority scoring (Engine 3B) |
| **Duplicate Handling** | Redundant work orders created | 200m spatial buffer clustering without silencing citizen reports (Engine 3A) |
| **Systemic Failure Detection**| Ignored until major disaster | Real-time velocity and spatial spike detection (Engine 3C) |
| **Incident Management** | Treats every complaint as isolated | Groups correlated complaints into single root-cause incidents (Engine 3D) |
| **Resolution Verification**| Contractor self-certification | Before/After photo comparison + Citizen feedback audit (Engine 3E) |
| **AI Role** | Unconstrained hallucination-prone bot | Grounded decision-support bound by PostgreSQL RLS and ticket citations |
| **Authorization** | Application-level checks | Database-level PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies |

## 🎯 Realistic Municipal Use Cases

- 🕳️ **Road & Infrastructure Hazards**: High-priority detection of deep potholes or road cave-ins near school zones, preventing vehicular accidents.
- 🚰 **Water & Sewage Emergencies**: Fast clustering of multiple contaminated water complaints across a 400m radius, isolating water main ruptures within hours.
- 💡 **Streetlight & Grid Failures**: Grouping 12 individual dark street complaints into a single electrical substation circuit work order.
- 🗑️ **Sanitation & Waste Management**: Detecting recurring garbage accumulation hotspots and tracking contractor remediation veracity.
- 🚨 **Public Safety & Monsoon Hazards**: Automated escalation of fallen trees, exposed live electrical wires, or flooded underpasses during severe weather events.
